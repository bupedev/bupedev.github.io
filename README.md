# Portfolio Website for `bupedev`

This repository hosts a Jekyll configuration for my portfolio website hosted at [bupe.dev](https://bupe.dev) (or [bupedev.github.io](https://bupedev.github.io)).

This repository will be updated with blog posts, art and links over time. Hopefully this website will form a solid portfolio of my works.
