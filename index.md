My name is Ben Lewis, I am a software engineer from Brisbane, Australia, currently building strategic mine planning software for [Deswik](https://www.deswik.com/). I studied at QUT where I completed two degrees, a Bachelor of Mathematics and a Bachelor of Engineering. When I am not spending time with my wife and my daughter, I enjoy creative coding and making generative art. This little corner of the internet is for me to share my learnings and creations.
